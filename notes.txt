FLOW:
1. We want a website where people can search english words and get the translations in several African languages.(not for serious research, just as a hobby).
2. Create Read Update Delete.
3. Interface for Create, Read, Update, Delete.
4. Authentication system for creating records.
5. Backend API for CRUD.
6. Frontend for interfacing with backend. 

Tasks:

BACKEND
1. Create postgres database schema. (tables include users table, Languages table, Language_Families table, Words table, Wordlist table ).
2. Create fastAPI server.
3. Connect server with database.
4. Create endpoints for uploading data.
5. Create endpoints for fetching data. 

FRONTEND
1. Create landing page. Should contain a search bar that will fetch data from the backend and display. Two inputs. First for the english word, second for the language family. Backend filters and returns results.
2. Add link to landing page that leads to a page showing the available searchable words.
3. Create a page (List Of Words Page)that contains all available words. The page should also have a search bar. For each word in the list of available words, add a button which when clicked, adds it to the search bar so that user can click enter and search.
4. Add a search filter to List of Words Page. Someone can search whether a certain word is available to be searched from the long list.
5. 

Tables
Words - (english_word, language_word_equivalent, language (relate to languages table), language_fam (relate to language families table), description, user)
WordList - (word, image)
